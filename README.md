# Collision-Avoidance-System

Simulated Software based project using Arduino UNO, Potentiometer, Ultrasonic Distance Sensor, LCD, LED, Resistor and compiled using Arduino programming to generate warning at a particular distance.

To live demonstrate the program, check this out https://wokwi.com/projects/375642954409749505

Steps to simulate:

Step 1: 
      Click on the run button to start the simulation

Step 2:
      Click on the Ultrasonic Distance Sensor to change the distance

Observations: As soon as the distance is less than 300cm. LCD displays the warning.
              
              And when the distance is greater than 300cm, the warning goes off.
              
              The dialouge at the bottom would show the Actual Measured Distance.

Modifications: The 300cm distance limit can be changed with change in the code.
